# Welcome to Dev Snippet 🎉

Welcome to **Dev Snippet** 🎉  

This repository is a showcase of my **early development projects, experiments, and practice work**.  
It represents the small steps I took at the beginning of my coding path, kept here as both a **reference for learning** and a **timeline of growth**.
