# Dev Snippet  


> *A collection of experiments, small builds, and the first steps in my coding journey.*  

Welcome to **Dev Snippet** ðŸŽ‰  

This repository is a showcase of my **early development projects, experiments, and practice work**.  
It represents the small steps I took at the beginning of my coding path, kept here as both a **reference for learning** and a **timeline of growth**.

- **`component/`** â†’ Contains subfolders, each representing a project, experiment, or snippet built during my initial development days.

## ðŸŒ± Why this repo?  

I created **Dev Snippet** to:  

- Document my **early coding journey**  
- Store my **first reusable components and snippets**  
- Share my **growth and experiments** with others
